# About
Well Logged provides access to well logs that were collected during the drilling for oil and gas. Because the data is difficult to obtain from state websites, I have scraped the data and made it easier to obtain. In addition, I am attempting to apply machine learning techniques to the data to convert the TIFF images into useable txt files that can be imported into standard software programs in the petroleum industry.

# Tech
I want to keep the project as small and simple as possible. No fancy libraries. Just some clean, raw, JavaScript.
